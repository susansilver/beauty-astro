Are you looking for some math love songs? I once made a mix tape for a mathematician. It only included mathematically related songs. I didn't keep a copy of that mix, unfortunately. This list includes more than the original. I've added some new math love songs and some about numbers. As well as other mathematical terms. I hope you will discover something new!

In no particular order...

### 1. Kiss Off - Violent Femmes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTUAaW3oGGo

There is a section in this song that has them counting off to ten. A great song. One of my favorites.

### 2. One - Harry Nilsson

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYzY7-V5vxY

Does anyone know what a busy signal is anymore? The origin of [one is the loneliest number](https://beautyofmathematics.com/one-harry-nilsson/).

### 3. Chicago x 12 - Rogue Wave

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8wulSNIo6A

A band that I love. Chosen for the multiplication in the title. The video has Bob Odenkirk. What more do you want?

### 4. Love and Mathematics - Broken Social Scene

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2fsKgxr-Zo

Another one of my favorite bands is the Canadian supergroup Broken Social Scene. This is also my favorite record by them. It seems kismet that they would include an instrumental track with this title. It is my love song for mathematics. It is also my most-played song of 2022.

### 5. Three is a Magic Number - Blind Melon

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6to8QyaA1Y

This was on an album that I owned of School House Rocks covers. It is one of my favorites as well.

### 6. Forecast Fascist Future - Of Montreal

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGhSjGsfJM0

This is an excuse to include a song that I love. But there is a bit at the end where he talks about numbers. It fits, I swear. ;)

### 7. Insurance Fraud #2 - Mountain Goats

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnjb0eZPxM4

I included this song because its title contains a number. Also, great band and a great song.

### 8. Pinball Number Count - The Postmarks

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5SxTz4yZ4

A cover of the Pointer Sisters Pinball Number Count from Sesame Street. It's slowed down and I find it rather relaxing.

### 9. Mandelbrot Set - Johnathan Coulton

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsutU92rrE

My first math dream was about the Mandelbrot Set.

### 10. Random Number Generation - Hedwig and the Angry Inch

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD7Hk7ytJ5w

This is the live version with Lena Hall and Miriam Shor. I love this video. The two Yitzhaks together with their powerful voices.

### 11. Back when I was 4 - Jeffrey Lewis

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXsjuAv05XY

Lots of number name checks in this one.ne of my favorite lyrics.

" And back when I was 12 or so I swear to god I never felt so low / Everyone but me was making out and eating cookies"

### 12. P.O Box 9847 - The Monkees

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxnMLPtXIzw

Another out-of-date reference to when people would leave personal ads with P.O. box numbers. But, yeah, another song that focuses on a number.

### 13. Psalms 40:2 - Mountain Goats

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7YQR27lykA

A second Mountain Goats song! Its got a number in the title and it rocks.

### 14. Zilch- The Monkees

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OedfVXal\_Y8

Zilch is another word for zero.

### 15. (What a) Wonderful World- Sam Cooke

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzlLi5jX\_C4

One of the great math love songs featuring a whole verse dedicated to mathematics.

### 16. 40 Day Dream - Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeroes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_e46GBxmoeU

That is some good psychedelic modern rock

### 17. Section 12 (Hold Me Now)- The Polyphonic Spree

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KrAPnHDfko

I heard this song in a commercial ad. It freaked me out because I thought this was rather obscure. Great song. I only learned about this band a few years ago from a friend. Good music.

### 18. Made-up Love Song #43 - The Guillemots

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EaAYi64Rpo

My favorite love song of all time. All time!

### 19. 1234 - Feist

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABYnqp-bxvg

A bit cliche because of its use in an iPod ad (remember ipods?) but this would be a mathematics mix without this song. Also, Feist is a member of Broken Social Scene.

### 20. Down at the So and So on Somewhere - The Fiery Furnaces

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ZCx0zEz8E

I didn't think that I would see this band on this list. But they did it. Brand new song after their hiatus and its first verse is pretty math intensive.

"Trigonometry tutors often go to dance class three times a week  
You taught me that at some point that night  
Connecting dots, tangent to your cheek  
You check your time warp watch in the car  
The angle ain't all oblique"

### 21. My Mathematical Mind - Spoon

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eta9DRyxlbM

Used to perfection in Stranger than Fiction. A [great film for Numberphiles](https://beautyofmathematics.com/favorite-video-every-year-numberphile/). Starring Will Ferrell, Tony Hale, Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifahah.

### 22. Another Hundred People - Company

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5he9I0CrXts

Pour one out for Stephen Sondheim. A classic song from a classic musical. You can just feel the pulse of New York in this one.

### 23.A Fortnight's Time - Maximo Park

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzX7bgNioOE

A mention of multiplication. Still added it to the list.

### 24. Infinity - BETTY

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAZjhy1bthY

  

The harmonies in this song are amazing. BETTY is a band that wrote and performed music for a [children's show on HBO called Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_(TV_series)). They are still around and making music.

### 25. X Amount of Words - Blue October

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFrWZfIndnA

This is a song that I listen to sometimes when I'm depressed. It knows my pain and how I feel when I'm having an episode. It is a good song to listen to if you know someone who struggles with their mental health.

This is a pretty good selection of math love songs and other mathematical favorites. I would love to hear if you have anything else to add to this list.
